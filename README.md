# Design Space Exploration

In this project, I used `SimpleScalar` as the evaluation engine to perform a design space exploration, using the provided framework code, over a 18-dimensional processor pipeline and memory hierarchy design space (some of these dimensions are not independent). I used a 5-benchmark suite as the workload.

You can run this project by `make` and `./DSE performance`.
